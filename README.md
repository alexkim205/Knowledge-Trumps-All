# Knowledge Trumps All - CDSS Hackathon 2018

This project was made in <18 hours at the 2018 Columbia Data Society Hackathon, and won the Best Usage of Google Cloud Platform prize. 

Our project involved completing NLP analysis on a variety of news articles, with the ultimate goal of determining the differences in writing style between news publishers. Additionally, we created a random forest model that was able to identify whether or not an inputted article would be promoted by the west wing. Finally, we created a website to display our analysis and allow users to use our model with their own choice of news articles.
